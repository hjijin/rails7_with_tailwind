# README

It's funny: I've never tried to use Rails6 since its release, and now that the latest rails7 has been released, I can say that I've missed the Rails6 version perfectly. On the one hand, my company's projects are still stuck in Rails5, on the other hand, I'm scared of Webpack, not familiar with it, not good with it, and find it expensive to learn, and I'm even more discouraged by the fact that Webpack itself is constantly changing.

## What's new in the latest Ruby on Rails 7?

* 1. Webpack and Node are not required
* 2. Encrypted Database Layer
* 3. Asynchronous Querying
* 4. Applications would only run in the Zeitwerk mode
* 5. UJS and Turbolinks is now replaced Stimulus and Turbo
* 6. Inline your query with a single record using sole
* 7. Use controller actions to the stream generated files
* 8. Named Variants

## Wrapping up

More about features and changes made, check out the Rails 7 release note. These aren't very comprehensive but will get updated sometime. If you are running on Rail 6 or lower, then remember that with the final release of Ruby on Rails 7, Rail 6.1 will not receive any bug fixes. You can now update Rail 7 and enjoy the latest updates and features.
